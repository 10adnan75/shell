# How to Run This Project

## Requirements
- Java 17 or higher (JDK)
- Maven (for building and running)
- (Optional) [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [TeX Live/MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) for generating PDF documentation

## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/10adnan75/shell.git
   cd shell
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```sh
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. **Run the shell:**
   ```sh
   ./your_program.sh
   ```
   Or, run directly with Java:
   ```sh
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=Main
   ```

4. **(Optional) Generate documentation PDF:**
   ```sh
   pandoc PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md -o PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.pdf --pdf-engine=pdflatex
   ```

## Notes
- The entry point is `src/main/java/Main.java`.
- All source code is in `src/main/java/core/` and `src/main/java/builtins/`.
- The shell supports built-in commands, external commands, pipelines, redirection, tab completion, and command history.

This is a starting point for Java solutions to the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

In this challenge, you'll build your own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. Along the way, you'll learn about shell command parsing,
REPLs, builtin commands, and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your `shell` implementation is in `src/main/java/Main.java`.
Study and uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first
stage:

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

Time to move on to the next stage!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `mvn` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main/java/Main.java`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
